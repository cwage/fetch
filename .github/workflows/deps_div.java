My first idea is to deceiving a Dependabot so that the bot will sends the token to my server instead of GitHub. This idea seems possible because there are flaws in URL validations.

One of the validations is to check whether the URL contains github.com or not. Obviously, this validation accepts a URL such as github.com.mocos.kitchen.

Another one uses following regexp which accepts a URL such as git+https://github.com.mocos.kitchen/username/repo.

      GIT_URL_REGEX = %r{
        (?<git_prefix>^|^git.*?|^github:|^bitbucket:|^gitlab:|github\.com/)
        (?<username>[a-z0-9-]+)/
        (?<repo>[a-z0-9_.-]+)
        (
          (?:\#semver:(?<semver>.+))|
          (?:\#(?=[\^~=<>*])(?<semver>.+))|
          (?:\#(?<ref>.+))
        )?$

Based on these tricks, Dependabot treats git+https://github.com.mocos.kitchen/username/repo as a valid GitHub’s URL.
First dive into a Dependabot server
Next, in order to try this attack in GitHub environment, I enabled Dependabot alerts in the sample repository. We can do this by simply creating a .github/dependabot.yml file.
